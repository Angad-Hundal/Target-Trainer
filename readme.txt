Part 1:
The code fulfill all the interaction and code requirements. It has been properly implemented and handle resize, shift clicking min radius and all the points. In lasso selection the move is working great but it is pretty sensitive and when it gets out of screen it shows error. And when inside the canvas it goes great.
Lasso selection is working good and lasso selection is only formed when you connect starting point and ending point with a margin of less than 50 otherwise it will go to rectangle selection.
When a node is deleted just move mouse a little and it will show the results. In undo and redo for del also just move the mouse a bit and it will show the result.s


Part 2:
The code satisfy all the requirements for undo and redo.


Part 3:
The code satisfy all the requirements for cut, copy and paste.


Part 4:
I was not able to shift with ctrl T and ctrl E but I have implemented the code for TargetTrainer view and TargetTrainer controller and Appmode listener. It used current blob to see which blob we are on. It uses Appmode listener for its implementaion. It handle the 3 Application modes. And each trial is handles using TrialRecord. It also implement the sccatter plot for ID versus time.
